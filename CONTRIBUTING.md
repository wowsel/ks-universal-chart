### Versioning

We follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for versioning:

- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for new functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- PATCH version for backwards compatible bug fixes

Update Chart.yaml version accordingly:
```yaml
version: X.Y.Z
```

### PR Title Convention

Format: `[type]: Description`

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes not affecting code logic
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Example: `[feat]: Add support for pod topology spread constraints`

## 📦 Release Process

1. Update documentation if needed
2. Create release tag following SemVer
3. Push release to Helm repository

## 🎨 Style Guidelines

### YAML Style
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Keep lines under 100 characters
- Use meaningful key names
- Group related configurations

### Documentation Style
- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include examples for new features
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
- Use emojis for better readability

### Example Values
