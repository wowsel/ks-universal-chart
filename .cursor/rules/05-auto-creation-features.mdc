# Auto-Creation Features

The chart supports automatic creation of related resources:

- `autoCreateService` - Creates Service based on container ports
- `autoCreateIngress` - Creates Ingress with optional SSL
- `autoCreateCertificate` - Manages SSL certificates via cert-manager
- `autoCreateServiceMonitor` - Creates Prometheus ServiceMonitor
- `autoCreatePdb` - Creates PodDisruptionBudget
- `autoCreateServiceAccount` - Creates dedicated ServiceAccount
- `autoCreateSoftAntiAffinity` - Adds soft anti-affinity to distribute pods

## Implementation Details

- Services are created based on container port definitions
- Ingress hostnames can be constructed from subdomain and global domain
- ServiceMonitors target ports with metrics in their name
- Certificates are created for ingress hosts
- PDBs are created with deployment selector labels
- Anti-affinity is added to distribute pods across nodes

## Configuration Examples

```yaml
deployments:
  app:
    # Enable auto-creation features
    autoCreateService: true
    autoCreateIngress: true
    autoCreateServiceMonitor: true
    
    # Configure auto-created resources
    serviceType: ClusterIP
    ingress:
      hosts:
        - subdomain: "app"
          paths:
            - path: "/"
              pathType: "Prefix"
    serviceMonitor:
      interval: "15s"
```
